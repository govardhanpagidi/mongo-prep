deleteMany()
--------------
db.collection.deleteMany(
   <filter>,
   {
      writeConcern: <document>,
      collation: <document>
   }
)

	- Removes all documents that match the filter from a collection.
	- To delete all documents in a collection, pass in an empty document ({ }).
	- Returns acknowledged and deletedCount
	- Throws WriteError if used on a capped collection. To remove all documents from a capped collection, use db.collection.drop() instead.
	- When using an hint, If you specify an index that does not exist, the operation errors.

deleteOne()
-----------------
db.collection.deleteOne(
   <filter>,
   {
      writeConcern: <document>,
      collation: <document>,
      hint: <document|string>        // Available starting in MongoDB 4.4
   }
)
	- Removes a single document from a collection.
	- Specify an empty document { } to delete the first document returned in the collection.
	- Returns acknowledged and deletedCount
	- Throws WriteError if used on a capped collection. To remove all documents from a capped collection, use db.collection.drop() instead.

Delete operations do not drop indexes, even if deleting all documents from a collection.

findOneAndDelete() provides a sort option. The option allows for the deletion of the first document sorted by the specified order.

remove()
-------------
db.collection.remove(
   <query>,
   <justOne>
)

or 

db.collection.remove(
   <query>,
   {
     justOne: <boolean>,
     writeConcern: <document>,
     collation: <document>
   }
)

	- <query> Specifies deletion criteria using query operators. To delete all documents in a collection, pass an empty document ({}).
	- To limit the deletion to just one document, set justOne: true. Omit to use the default value of false and delete all documents matching the deletion criteria.
	- Returns WriteResult containing nRemoved with number of documents removed.
	- By default, remove() removes all documents that match the query expression. Specify the justOne option to limit the operation to removing a single document. To delete a single document sorted by a specified order, use the findAndModify() method.
	- You cannot use the remove() method with a capped collection.
	- Remove on a sharded collection that specify the justOne: true option must include the shard key or the _id field. Otherwise, will return an error.

db.collection.remove({}) removes all documents in a collection. This is not equivalent to drop() method. using drop is more efficient to drop the entire collection including indexes.
