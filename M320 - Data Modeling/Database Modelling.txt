MongoDB
	- Schema-less is a misconception. All database have a base schema. Flexible Schema Database.
	- Stores in BSON.
	- JSON 
		- Human readable and writable
		- Machine parsable and generatable
		- Language independent

constraints in database modelling
	- RAM, Hardware, Application network latency, DB server / MongoDb max limit, ACID compliance
	- Tips
		- Keep frequently used documents in RAM (working sets)
		- Keep indexes in RAM
		- Prefer SSDs to HDDs	
		- Infrequently accessed data can use HDDs

Data modelling methodology
	- Define workload (data size, important read/writes, quantify ops, qualify ops)
	- Relationships between models (identify, quantify, link or embed them)
	- Apply Design Patterns
	- Design / Transformations  (apply the ones needed for optimizations)
	- Schema
		- Scenarios
		- Business Domain expert
		- Existing system schema / production logs & stats

modelling for simplicity vs performance
simplicity will favor embedding
performance will create more collections

Data Model Design - 
	- Embedded or De-normalized Data model - Suitable for One-to-One and One-to-Many relationships if many is not very large.
	- Normalized Data Model - References between documents. Use when: 
		- embedding would result in duplication but would not provided sufficient read performance advantages to outweigh the implications of the duplication.
		- to represent complex many-to-many relationships
		- to model large hierarchial data sets.

Operational Factors and Data Models
	- Atomicity (Embedded Data Model and Multi-Document Transaction)
	- Sharding 
	- Indexes (each index requires atleast 8 KB of data space)
	- Large Number of Collections (Distinct collections with minimal overheads)
	- Collection contains large number of small documents (Rolling up small documents into large)
	- Storage Optimization of Small Documents (custom _id field, shorter field names, embed documents etc.)
	- Data Lifecycle Management (for ex. TTL feature and capped collections for using only recently inserted documents as it follows FIFO management of inserted documents)
