Relationships
	- One to Many, Many to One and Many to Many
	- Crow's foot notation - One to Zillions
	- When High Cardinality is involved, use One to Zillions instead of one to many

One to Many
	- Embed or Reference, one or many side.
	- Embed in the One side. Documents from many side are embedded. Most common for simple apps, few docs to embed
	- Embed in the many side. Less often used. Useful if many side is queried more often than one side. Embedded object is duplicated but may be ok or preferable.
	- Embed on the side of the most queried collection.
	- Prefer referencing when the associated documents are not always needed with the most often queried documents.
	- Reference in the one side. Array of references across 2 collections. Allows for large docs and high count. Cascade deletes are not supported and application should manage these.
	- Reference in the many side. preferred representation using references.Allows for large docs and high count. No need to manage the referneces on the one side.

Many to Many
	- Embed or Reference, Many side.
	- Can be replaced by 2 one-to-many relationships but does not have to with the document model.
	- Prefer embedding on the most queried side.	
	- Prefer embedding for information that is primarily static over time and may profit from duplication.
	- Prefer referencing over embedding to avoid managing duplication.
	Embed
		- Array of sub-documents in either of many sides.
		- Most queried side is considered. Documents from less queried side are embedded.
		- Results in duplication
		- keep source for the embedded documents in another collection
		- Indexing is done on the array
	Reference
		- Array of references in either of many side.
		- References readily available on the main side upon first query. Need second query if on the other side.


One to One
	- Embed or Reference
	- Prefer embedding over Referencing for simplicity.
	Embed
		- fields at same level. very similar to tabular databases
		- grouping in sub-documents. preferred representation. preserves simplicity as documents are clearer.

	Reference
		- same identifier in both documents
		- in the main one side or secondary one side
		- adds complexity. preferred for optimization purposes

One to Zillions
	- Never use embed
	- Always Reference on the many side
	- Extra attention or comments to queries or code that handles the zillions of documents
